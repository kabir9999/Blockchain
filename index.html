            <p>A <strong>blockchain</strong> is a distributed ledger with growing lists of records (blocks) that are
                securely linked together via cryptographic hashes.[1][2][3][4] Each block contains a cryptographic hash
                of
                the previous block, a timestamp, and transaction data (generally represented as a Merkle tree, where
                data
                nodes are represented by leaves). Since each block contains information about the previous block, they
                effectively form a chain (compare linked list data structure), with each additional block linking to the
                ones before it. Consequently, blockchain transactions are irreversible in that, once they are recorded,
                the
                data in any given block cannot be altered retroactively without altering all <a href="#block1">
                    <p>subsequent blocks.</p>
                </a>
            <p></p> Blockchains are typically managed by a peer-to-peer (P2P) computer network for use as a public
            distributed ledger, where nodes collectively adhere to a consensus algorithm protocol to add and validate
            new
            transaction blocks. Although blockchain records are not unalterable, since blockchain forks are possible,
            blockchains may be considered secure by design and exemplify a distributed computing system with high
            Byzantine
            fault tolerance.<sup>[5]</sup>
            <br>
            A blockchain was created by a person (or group of people) using the name (or pseudonym) Satoshi Nakamoto in
            2008
            to serve as the public distributed ledger for bitcoin cryptocurrency transactions, based on previous work by
            Stuart Haber, W. Scott Stornetta, and Dave Bayer.[6] The implementation of the blockchain within bitcoin
            made it
            the first digital currency to solve the double-spending problem without the need of a trusted authority or
            central server. The bitcoin design has inspired other applications[3][2] and blockchains that are readable
            by
            the public and are widely used by cryptocurrencies. The blockchain may be considered a type of payment
            rail.<sup>[7]</sup>
            <br>
            Private blockchains have been proposed for business use. Computerworld called the marketing of such
            privatized
            blockchains without a proper security model "snake oil";[8] however, others have argued that permissioned
            blockchains, if carefully designed, may be more decentralized and therefore more secure in practice than
            permissionless ones.<sup>[4][9]</sup></p>

            <p>Cryptographer David Chaum first proposed a blockchain-like protocol in his 1982 dissertation</p>
            <p>"Computer Systems Established, Maintained, and Trusted by Mutually Suspicious Groups."[10] Further work
                on a
                cryptographically secured chain of blocks was described in 1991 by Stuart Haber and W. Scott
                Stornetta.[4][11] They wanted to implement a system wherein document timestamps could not be tampered
                with.
                In 1992, Haber, Stornetta, and Dave Bayer incorporated Merkle trees into the design, which improved its
                efficiency by allowing several document certificates to be collected into one block.[4][12] Under their
                company Surety, their document certificate hashes have been published in The New York Times every week
                since
                1995.<sup>[13]</sup>
                <br>
                The first decentralized blockchain was conceptualized by a person (or group of people) known as Satoshi
                Nakamoto in 2008. Nakamoto improved the design in an important way using a Hashcash-like method to
                timestamp
                blocks without requiring them to be signed by a trusted party and introducing a difficulty parameter to
                stabilize the rate at which blocks are added to the chain.[4] The design was implemented the following
                year
                by Nakamoto as a core component of the cryptocurrency bitcoin, where it serves as the public ledger for
                all
                transactions on the network.<sup>[3]</sup>
                <br><br>
                In August 2014, the bitcoin blockchain file size, containing records of all transactions that have
                occurred
                on the network, reached 20 GB (gigabytes).[14] In January 2015, the size had grown to almost 30 GB, and
                from
                January 2016 to January 2017, the bitcoin blockchain grew from 50 GB to 100 GB in size. The ledger size
                had
                exceeded 200 GB by early 2020.
                The words block and chain were used separately in Satoshi Nakamoto's original paper, but were eventually
                popularized as a single word, blockchain, by 2016.[16]
                <br><br>
                According to Accenture, an application of the diffusion of innovations theory suggests that blockchains
                attained a 13.5% adoption rate within financial services in 2016, therefore reaching the early adopters'
                phase.[17] Industry trade groups joined to create the Global Blockchain Forum in 2016, an initiative of
                the
                Chamber of Digital Commerce.
                <br>
                In May 2018, Gartner found that only 1% of CIOs indicated any kind of blockchain adoption within their
                organisations, and only 8% of CIOs were in the short-term "planning or [looking at] active
                experimentation
                with blockchain".[18] For the year 2019 Gartner reported 5% of CIOs believed blockchain technology was a
                'game-changer' for their business.[19]

            <p>A blockchain is a decentralized, distributed, and often public, digital ledger consisting of records
                called
                blocks that are used to record transactions across many computers so that any involved block cannot be
                altered retroactively, without the alteration of all subsequent blocks.<sup>[3][20]</sup>
                <br>
                This allows the participants to verify and audit transactions independently and relatively
                inexpensively.[21] A blockchain database is managed autonomously using a peer-to-peer network and a
                distributed timestamping server. They are authenticated by mass collaboration powered by collective
                self-interests.<sup>[22]</sup>
                <br>
                Such a design facilitates robust workflow where participants' uncertainty regarding data security is
                marginal. The use of a blockchain removes the characteristic of infinite reproducibility from a digital
                asset. It confirms that each unit of value was transferred only once, solving the long-standing problem
                of
                double-spending. A blockchain has been described as a value-exchange protocol.<sup>[23]</sup>
                <br>
                A blockchain can maintain title rights because, when properly set up to detail the exchange agreement,
                it
                provides a record that compels offer and acceptance.<sup>[citation needed]</sup>
            </p>

            <p>Logically, a blockchain can be seen as consisting of several layers:<sup>[24]</sup></p>

            <h3>Blocks</h3>
            <p>Blocks hold batches of valid transactions that are hashed and encoded into a Merkle tree.[3] Each block
                includes the cryptographic hash of the prior block in the blockchain, linking the two. The linked blocks
                form a chain.[3] This iterative process confirms the integrity of the previous block, all the way back
                to
                the initial block, which is known as the genesis block (Block 0).[26][27] To assure the integrity of a
                block
                and the data contained in it, the block is usually digitally signed.[28]
                <br>
                <br>

                Sometimes separate blocks can be produced concurrently, creating a temporary fork. In addition to a
                secure
                hash-based history, any blockchain has a specified algorithm for scoring different versions of the
                history
                so that one with a higher score can be selected over others. Blocks not selected for inclusion in the
                chain
                are called orphan blocks.[27] Peers supporting the database have different versions of the history from
                time
                to time. They keep only the highest-scoring version of the database known to them. Whenever a peer
                receives
                a higher-scoring version (usually the old version with a single new block added) they extend or
                overwrite
                their own database and retransmit the improvement to their peers. There is never an absolute guarantee
                that
                any particular entry will remain in the best version of history forever. Blockchains are typically built
                to
                add the score of new blocks onto old blocks and are given incentives to extend with new blocks rather
                than
                overwrite old blocks. Therefore, the probability of an entry becoming superseded decreases
                exponentially[29]
                as more blocks are built on top of it, eventually becoming very low.[3][30]: ch. 08 [31] For example,
                bitcoin uses a proof-of-work system, where the chain with the most cumulative proof-of-work is
                considered
                the valid one by the network. There are a number of methods that can be used to demonstrate a sufficient
                level of computation. Within a blockchain the computation is carried out redundantly rather than in the
                traditional segregated and parallel manner.<sup>[32]</sup>

        <article id="block time">
            <h3 id="block1">Block time</h3>
            <p>The block time is the average time it takes for the network to generate one extra block in the
                blockchain. By
                the time of block completion, the included data becomes verifiable. In cryptocurrency, this is
                practically
                when the transaction takes place, so a shorter block time means faster transactions. The block time for
                Ethereum is set to between 14 and 15 seconds, while for bitcoin it is on average 10
                minutes.<sup>[33]</sup>
